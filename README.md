# Deep Learning

This space is to tune my practical deep learning skills. I will develop various deep learning projects from the scratch using PyTorch and will upload the notebooks here.

1. Fashion MNIST - Multi Class Image Classification using modified LeNet [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning/blob/master/fashion-mnist.ipynb)
2. Language Words - Multi Class Word Classification using character level RNN [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning/blob/master/2-multi-class-word-classification.ipynb)
