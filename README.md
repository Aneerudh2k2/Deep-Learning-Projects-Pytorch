# Deep Learning Projects using PyTorch

This space is to tune my practical deep learning skills. I will develop various deep learning projects using PyTorch without any Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V and will upload the notebooks here.

1. [Image] **Fashion MNIST Dataset** - Multi Class Image Classification using modified LeNet [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning-projects-pytorch/blob/master/1-multi-class-image-classification-fashion-mnist.ipynb)
2. [Text] **Language Words Dataset** - Multi Class Word Classification using character level LSTM [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning/blob/master/2-multi-class-word-classification.ipynb)
3. [Text] **US Baby Names Dataset** - Name Generation using character level LSTM [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning/blob/master/3-baby-name-generation.ipynb)
4. [Image] Neural Style Transfer using pre trained VGG19 Net [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning/blob/master/4-neural-style-transfer.ipynb)
5. [Image + Text] **CAPTCHA Dataset** - Text Recognition with CRNN using pre trained RESNET and Bi-GRU [[Link]]( https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning-projects-pytorch/blob/master/5-captcha-text-recognition-with-crnn.ipynb)
